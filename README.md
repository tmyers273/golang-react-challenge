# Golang Coding Challenge

### Brief

Implement a basic reactive system.

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on how values
are computed in terms of each other to allow a change to one value to
automatically propagate to other values, like in a spreadsheet (or Causal).

Our users are building very large models and to keep the latency as low as
possible we should only re-compute the minimal set of numbers.

Implement a basic reactive system with cells with settable values ("input"
cells) and cells with values computed in terms of other cells ("compute"
cells). Implement updates so that when an input value is changed, values
propagate to reach a new stable system state.

In addition, compute cells should allow for registering change notification
callbacks.  Call a cell’s callbacks when the cell’s value in a new stable
state has changed from the previous stable state.

### Coding the solution

Look for a stub file having the name react.go
and place your solution code in that file.

### Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `go test` from within the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `--bench` and `--benchmem`
flags:

    go test -v --bench . --benchmem

Keep in mind that each reviewer will run benchmarks on a different machine, with
different specs, so the results from these benchmark tests may vary.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Go best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features? Are all the tests running?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?


### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes
to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,

The Causal Team
